Tunrip in a Case

This is a simple game that runs a python script called " Turn in a Case " Based on Carrot in a Box by Al Sweigart
## Getting Started

Turnip.py will run after you have installed and loaded it into your IDE and shall run as  standalone game for demonstration purposes


### Prerequisites

Turnip.py requires Python version 3 and above and any interface on Windwos, Mac OS or Linux/Debian to launch this.

Of course, you will need to ensure your local Python terminal has been updated by doing prefunctory commands of
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install package1 package2
```


#Running
Once you have the project loaded into your IDE, you can run it by running ' Turnip.py'

```

## Thanks
Kudos goes to the original creator of Carrot in a Box, Al Sweigart, and to my instructors at RTC, Zak Rubin and Justin Ellis.
